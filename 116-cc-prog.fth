\ 116-cc-prog.fth — file-scope forms and the top-level driver for the C-subset
\ compiler.
\
\ Parses enums, typedefs, prototypes, and global variables, skips the forms
\ it has no code for, and compiles a whole translation unit (cc-parse-program).
\
\ The compiled output begins with a 26-byte entry stub at vaddr 0x400078:
\     mov rdi, [rsp]   ; 48 8B 3C 24             (4 bytes, argc)
\     lea rsi, [rsp+8] ; 48 8D 74 24 08          (5 bytes, argv)
\     call <main>      ; E8 <rel32>             (5 bytes)
\     mov rdi, rax     ; 48 89 C7                (3 bytes)
\     mov rax, 60      ; 48 C7 C0 3C 00 00 00    (7 bytes)
\     syscall          ; 0F 05                    (2 bytes)
\
\ Then come the shims, declarations, and function bodies.  main returns its
\ value in rax (SYS-V); the stub moves it to rdi and exits.  The call's rel32
\ is patched after main's vaddr is known.
\
\ Depends on 114-cc-func.fth and everything it depends on.

\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\ Top-level forward-decl / file-scope-var elision.
\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\ Our compiler only knows how to emit code for `int NAME(params) { body }`
\ function definitions.  When parsing real-world C headers we encounter a
\ profusion of other top-level forms:
\
\   void f(args);             /* forward fn decl, non-int return type */
\   char* f(args);            /* forward fn decl, pointer return type */
\   struct T* f(args);        /* forward fn decl, struct-ptr return type */
\   int f(args);              /* forward fn decl, int return type (no body) */
\   extern int g;             /* file-scope variable */
\   struct T* g_list;         /* file-scope variable */
\
\ None of these need to GENERATE anything in our target (the body is missing
\ for forward decls; file-scope vars aren't yet supported).  But they DO need
\ to PARSE without exploding so the headers can flow through.
\
\ Strategy: at top level, when we see a type-introducing keyword (int / char /
\ void / struct / typedef-name) that isn't a struct/enum/typedef DEFINITION,
\ cc-top-classify peeks ahead, paren-balanced, to the first ';' or '{' at
\ depth 0 and sorts the declaration into one of three classes:
\   - '{' first               → top-fndef: a function definition.
\   - ';' first, a '(' before → top-proto: a prototype; register the name.
\   - ';' first, no '('       → top-var: a file-scope variable.
\ The peek marks the lexer state in cc-peek-mark and resets to it, so the
\ parser that handles the class starts from the declaration's first token.

\ Caller has put-back the first token of the prototype.  Consumes through ';'.
\
\ Idempotency: real-world headers often re-declare the same prototype across
\ TUs (e.g. M2-Planet has `struct token_list* read_all_tokens(...)` in both
\ cc_macro.c and cc.c, with the definition in cc_reader.c sandwiched in
\ between).  Concatenated into our monolith the post-definition prototype
\ would register a new sk-func with val=0, and because cc-sym-find returns
\ the newest match, every later call site emits a forward-call placeholder
\ against a stale entry whose fixups are never patched.  Skip the re-add if
